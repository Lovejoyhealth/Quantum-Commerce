# Quantum-Commerce

Quantum-Commerce is a proof-of-concept application that explores the intersection of quantum theory, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence to deliver hyper-personalized e-commerce experiences. By simulating a user's cognitive traits and biometric data, the platform creates a dynamic "Cognitive State Vector" that, combined with real-time browsing context, shapes product recommendations through a quantum cognitive model. This emotion-aware recommender demonstrates how personalized engagement can be achieved without compromising user privacy, as raw bioinformatics data never leaves the device. The result is a dynamic, interactive shopping simulation where recommendations adapt fluidly to the user's emotional and cognitive stateâ€”pushing the boundaries of next-generation personalization in commerce.
